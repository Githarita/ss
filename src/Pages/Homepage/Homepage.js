          Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs
          and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she
          sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. The first little
          pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his
          house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder
          but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks.
          Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.
          The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with
          bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and
          chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds. The
          next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little
          pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside.
          He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began
          to water. So he knocked on the door and said: So he huffed and he
          puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to
          catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His
          big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs
          scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them. The
          wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they
          made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf
          could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened,
          they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true.
          The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite
          chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them
          inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely
          feast. Well! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he
          huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house
          down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he
          couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit. But
          this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would
          come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But
          while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing
          fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the
          wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy pulled off the lid,
          and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water. So the little
          piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little
          pigs ate him for supper.
